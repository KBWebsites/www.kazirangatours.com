One of the most culturally diverse regions of the world, Northeast India is an anthropologist's delight with around 100 different tribes that are found here with their own distinct tradition, culture, language and dress. More then 20 different tribes can be found in Arunachal Pradesh alone and around 16 in Nagaland. 

In this grand tour, you will travel through the states of North East India, visiting various landscapes inhabited by some of the fascinating tribes of the region. The highlight of the tour will be your interaction with the host communities to know more about their culture and traditions.

Do not miss the opportunity to enjoy this unique tour as most of these age old traditions are now slowly changing with the passage of time.
