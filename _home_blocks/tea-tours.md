"Thank god for tea! What would the world do without tea! How did it exist? I am glad I was not born before tea." - Sydney Smith

Imagine getting up in the morning, listening to the chirping of birds with a hot cup of freshly brewed tea by your side. As you look out, you see the lush green tea gardens all around. Live the life of a tea planter during the days of the Raj and learn about the history and manufacturing process of tea, the cup that cheers.

Kaziranga Tours has designed special tea tours where you can stay in the heritage tea bungalows and also visit different villages and wildlife parks.
