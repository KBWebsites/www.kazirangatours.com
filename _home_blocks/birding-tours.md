Birding in Northeast India is not only an amazing experience but it is a bird watchers dream come true.  The International Council for Bird Preservation, UK identified the Assam plains and the Eastern Himalaya as an Endemic Bird Area (EBA). This region has a distinctly different climate with warmer mean temperatures and fewer days with frost and has much higher rainfall. This has resulted in the occurrence of a rich array of restricted range bird species. More than two critically endangered species, three endangered species and 14 vulnerable species of birds are in this EBA.  With a variety of habitat options like wetlands, grassland, woodland, sub tropical and rain forests, coniferous, and alpine scrubs spread over an accessible altitude of 100m to over 4500m, a number of National parks and Wild Life Sanctuaries the north east of India provides a fantastic opportunity for an ultimate birding experience. Some of the important birding areas are Kaziranga NP (with over 450 birds), Dibru saikhowa NP (with over 350 birds), Namdhapa (With over  650 birds), West Arunachal Pradesh (Eagles Nest, Pakke and Dirang-Sela: With over 450 birds), Manas NP (with over  380 birds), Eastern Arunachal Pradesh (with over 350 birds)  and Nameri NP (with over 350 birds) to name a few.
